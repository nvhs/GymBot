# ðŸ¤– GymBot

A selenium-python app that automatically enrolls you in your preferred workout session (and soon group classes) 

## How it Works

Using Selenium WebDriver, the Python code will navigate through the YMCA site and book a workout session according to the
parameters set in the config file: location and preferred time slot(s). The app is hosted by Heroku and uses the scheduler 
to run the app daily at 7:00 AM EST to make bookings for 7 days in advance.

## Installation
1. ``` git clone https://github.com/nvhs/gymbot.git ```
2. ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
3. ``` heroku create ```
4. ``` git push heroku main ```
5. ``` heroku addons: create scheduler:standard ```
6. ``` heroku addons:open scheduler ```
7. In the Heroku Scheduler Dashboard add a new job and set to 03:00 (07:00 EST)
